# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

1. Start by setting up your project environment.
- Make sure Node is installed from the terminal: node --version
- Install the packages Express, Body-Parser, and Cors from the terminal: npm install express/cors/body-parser
- and them include them your server.js file: const e/c/b = require('express/cors/body-parser') + app.use(e,c,b())
- Create a server running on the port of your choosing - const port + const server = app.listen(port, listening)
- Add a console.log() to the server callback function, and test that your server is running using Node in the terminal to run the file server.js: function listening( {console.log(port)})
